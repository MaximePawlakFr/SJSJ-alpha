# Jasmine

[Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) is a behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code. It does not depend on any other JavaScript frameworks. It does not require a DOM. 

Jasmine is developed by [Pivotal Labs](http://pivotal.io/labs), and has many features like [Spies](http://jasmine.github.io/2.0/introduction.html#section-Spies) built in.  

It also has support for mocking [AJAX](http://jasmine.github.io/2.0/ajax.html).
